h1. TEXTILE

p=. *A Humane Web Text Generator*

p=. A lightweight markup language that takes (almost) plaintext and converts it into well formed HTML.


h2. Installation

The only file that is necessary for the correct operation of Textile is @classTextile.php@ from the project root directory. However, to use additional features you may need to install other files from the project tree.

For live installations only files and subdirectories from the *@master@* branch should be used. _Code from other branches should *never* be used on live sites._


h2. Usage

Simply create an instance of class @Textile@ and pass it what you want to convert. Like so...

bc.. include "classTextile.php"; # adjust paths if needed.
$textile = new Textile();
$output = $textile->TextileThis( $trusted_input );

p. If you are using Textile to format user-supplied input, for blog comments for instance, use the restricted mode call...

bc.. include "classTextile.php"; # adjust paths if needed.
$textile = new Textile();
$output = $textile->TextileRestricted( $untrusted_input );
